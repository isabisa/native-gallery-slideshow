Adds a select box to the native WordPress gallery screen, which allows you to choose between the default grid style gallery or slideshow. Uses Cycle2 for the slideshow functionality.

== Description ==
This plugin uses the native WordPress media manager to allow you to create a slideshow. It adds a select box to the gallery settings, which allows you to choose between the default grid style gallery or a slideshow.

The slideshow uses Cycle2. It is responsive, scrolls horizontally, has previous and next buttons, supports touch events, and automatically adjusts the height of the container based on the height of the images.

Additionally, this plugin:
* Changes the default image link to file
* Allows you to choose the size of image for grids
* Sets default size for grids to thumbnail
* Sets default size for slideshows to large

== Installation ==
